# Fridge Inventory

### Intro
This program is a proof of concept and test of features for a future mobile app. This app will use the camera to scan barcodes and then keep track of grocceries you have bought.
It will have a scan function that will see if the product has been stored before you can just add it. If it is a new item then you will be asked to give it a name and a price. It will the be stored in a database. This program allows you to see your total groccery costs and what you use most to find best places to save. 

### Development

This will be a web app to get started on the database and main UX design and how it will work on the back-end. This project will be using a NoSQL database on GCP Firestore. It will also use firebase to verifty users. Python will be used for the data visulisation and statistics. Docker containers to make the project run independently and recreatably. Future addition may come.

### Requirements
Google Cloud Products
Node JS
Docker

### Future
Remove feature to keep exact track of the items that have been removed
